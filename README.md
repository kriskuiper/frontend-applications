My awesome project is a web app where students can explore the NVMW collection and create expos themselves based on four different themes. Users can do the following things:
* Explore the collections of four different themes
* Create expo's by adding items or deleting items
* Show their expo's to friends using the expos page

## Getting started
My awesome project is built using Preact bootstrapped using the Preact CLI.

For detailed explanation on how things work using the `preact-cli`, checkout the [CLI Readme](https://github.com/developit/preact-cli/blob/master/README.md).

### Prerequisites
Before getting started you should have the following things sorted out:

### Scripts
``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# spin up a dev server with hot reloading
npm run dev
```

## Testing
Since jest is installed you can write unit tests for every component if you want to. Make sure to install `jest-preset-preact` beforehand
